# Java Game Scheduler
## Java Practice Assignment
Problem: Game Scheduler is an application which generates various reports based on schedule of the games e.g. Olympic Games Schedule.

Application accepts information about Games, Players and Days on which games are scheduled.

A Player can play multiple games. On a Day, multiple games can be scheduled.

Application should generate following reports.

1. Game wise Report - Given the name of the Game, display Players who are playing the Game and Days on which this Game is scheduled.

2. Player wise Report - Given the name of the Player, display the Games that he plays and the days on which these games are scheduled.

3. Day wise Report - Given the name of the Day, display the Games which are scheduled on that day and the players who play these games.

Application is not expected to create the schedule. Schedule needs to be fed to the system.

Appropriate validations should be done e.g. No Duplicate Players, Games, Days etc.
